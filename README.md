## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing optimized SQL queries using `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and `CASE`
- Performing data cleaning within SQL (e.g., removing NULLs, trimming spaces)
- Using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`) for summary statistics
- Filtering and sorting to draw conclusions from raw data
